  "Пройти_тест": "1. You can only go back one question and change your answer. 2. There is only one correct answer for each question, multiple options cannot be selected. 3. You can pause the time by pressing the 'Pause' button and return to the test at any time. 4. The test is not limited in time. 5. The test consists of several sections (blocks) with questions on various topics.",
  "Благодаря_вопросам": "Thanks to special questions, you will be able to take a fresh look at the material you have mastered. You will also be able to evaluate your knowledge on each of the topics, and see which topic needs more attention. Thanks to the final report, you can clearly see where your gaps in knowledge or skills are, and focus on them",
  "После_прохождения": "After passing the test, you will have access to information about the test results: the number of points scored, the time spent on the test, explanations for each answer, the level of knowledge for each block of questions",
  "Для_оценки": "To assess knowledge, the required number of questions should be in the range from 30 to 50. A smaller number of questions does not make it possible to accurately assess the level of knowledge of a person. Therefore, tests popular on the Internet for 3, 5 or 10 questions cannot give an accurate assessment. Using more than 50 questions for the test increases the duration of the test, which further entails a loss of concentration. Therefore, the optimal range is from 30 to 50 questions. Therefore, this site uses 40 questions.",
